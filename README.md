My Wildermyth Mods
I have created sets of fun mods that alter hair and skin colours, systems and character generation. Contain various options to experience differently with each gameplay.

I have uploaded them to Github so that everyone who bought Wildermyth (regardless of the digital shop) can have access to them without the need to register anywhere.

Of course, anyone who bought it on Steam and wants to upload the mods to SteamWorkshop is free to do so as long as they don't modify the files and leave the original link in the Mod post. In the future I will upload them to a Mod website like Nexus.
