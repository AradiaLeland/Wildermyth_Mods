My Wildermyth Mods - Aesthetic alterations and character generation

I have created sets of fun mods that alter hair and skin colours and that alter character generation. Both contain various options to experiment with each game.

I have uploaded them to Github so that everyone who bought Wildermyth (regardless of the shop) can have access to them without the need to register anywhere.

Of course, anyone who bought it on Steam and wants to upload the mods to Steam Workshop or another platform is free to do so as long as they don't modify the files (especially the author section) and leave the original link in the post.
